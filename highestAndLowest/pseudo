input 
a string of numbers, to give me the highest and lowest number as 
a string

function


output
'1 3 4 5 6 8' = '1 8'


PSEUDO

1. //function statement named highAndLow with parameter numbers

2. //numbers assigned to numbers split method pattern as space
//map method with function for every element Number conversion

3. //return Math.max strict function with apply method plus empty string
//with space to convert to string from number and give the two
//numbers a space in between
