## check the exam, third program

The first input array is the key to the correct answers to an exam, like ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one contains a student's submitted answers.

The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer, represented as an empty string (in C the space character is used).

If the score < 0, return 0.

For example:

checkExam(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "c", "b", "d"]) → 6
checkExam(["a", "a", "c", "b"], ["a", "a", "b",  ""]) → 7
checkExam(["a", "a", "b", "c"], ["a", "a", "b", "c"]) → 16
checkExam(["b", "c", "b", "a"], ["",  "a", "a", "c"]) → 0

## disemvowel trolls

Description:

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
