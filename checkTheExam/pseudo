function


output
["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "c", "b", "d"]) â†’ 6



1. //function statement named checkExam with parameters
//array1 and array2

2.//set a variable named score to zero

3.//for loop initialization variable i assigned to zero; condition
//i is less than array1.length; final expression i plus plus

4.//statement//
//if array1 index i equal to array2 index i 


5.//score plus equals 4 [ie score variable equals 
			//score plus 4]

6. //else if [move on to next string if previous does not apply]
		// if array2 index i equals empty string

7.//score plus equals 0[ie score variable equals score plus 0]

8.//else[ie move on to the next string if prev does not apply]

9. //score minus equals 1
//[[ie score variable equals score minus one]]

10.	//if conditional statement with score less than 0 condition

11. //statement to be executed if condition is truthy 
		//score equal zero

12.	//return score
